Yunoga is the font the Sweax iZone's organisation prefers for displaying code sections inside say manuals and websites, specially in its own variant of the Metro design.

Yunoga is not an actual font by itself; it's simply an alias for the [Courier 10 Pitch](https://github.com/sweaxizone/cour10p) font.
